# DSL Overview

Wardley Mapping is a framework for visualizing your environment so you can make better decisions. OnlineWardleyMaps uses a Domain Specific Language (DSL) to define Wardley Maps in a concise, readable format. This allows you to create, edit, and share maps as plain text.

## Basic Syntax

- Each line represents a map element or relationship.
- Comments start with `#` and are ignored.
- Indentation is not required.

Mapping is a craft—embrace the messiness, iterate, and learn by doing.

## Core Elements

### [Anchor](map-components/anchor.md)

Every map starts with an **anchor**—the user or stakeholder need. This sets the context for all dependencies and components below.

### [Component](map-components/component.md)

Components are situation-relevant things (activities, practices, data, knowledge) that make up your value chain.

### [Market](map-components/market.md)

Markets represent the broader context or environment in which your components operate.

### [Pipeline](map-components/pipeline.md)

Pipelines simplify complex flows or processes, connecting components across stages of evolution.

### [Links & Flows](map-components/link.md)

Dependencies between components form the value chain, showing how needs are met through supporting capabilities.

### [Evolution & Inertia](map-components/evolution.md)

The horizontal axis shows how components evolve from genesis to commodity. Mark components as evolving or facing inertia.

### [Build, Buy, Outsource](map-components/build-buy-outsource.md)

Highlight execution strategies for components—how they will be delivered.

### [Submaps & URLs](map-components/submap.md)

Link components to submaps or external resources for complex systems.

### [Notes](map-components/note.md)

Annotate your map with additional information, context, or reminders.

### [Styles & Evolution Stages](map-components/style.md)

Change the look and feel of your map and customize evolution stage labels.
