# Links & Flows

**Links** (or flows) represent dependencies between components. In Wardley Mapping, a component higher on the map depends on a component lower down. These dependencies form the value chain, showing how needs are met through supporting capabilities.

On a map, you do not usually write "depends on" â€” the direction of the link implies the dependency.

## Syntax

```text
Start Component->End Component
Start Component->End Component; additional context label
Start Component+<>End Component
Start Component+<End Component
Start Component+>End Component
Start Component+'label'>End Component
```

## Example

```text
component Customer [0.94, 0.62] 
component Cup of Tea [0.74, 0.62] 
component Kettle [0.30, 0.35]
component Hot Water [0.53, 0.62]

Customer->Cup of Tea
Hot Water+'$0.10'>Kettle; limited by
Cup of Tea->Hot Water
```

:::tip
Only add dependencies that are important for your story. Mapping is about revealing what matters.

## Annotations

You can add context to pipeline links using annotations. This allows you to highlight relationships such as "limited by", "constraint", or "feedback loop" without using additional notes.

### Annotation Syntax

```text
ComponentA->ComponentB; limited by
```

### Annotation Example

```text
component Hot Water [0.60, 0.74]
component Kettle [0.45, 0.57] 
pipeline Kettle
{
  component Campfire Kettle [0.50] 
  component Electric Kettle [0.63]
}

Hot Water->Kettle; limited by
```

These annotations help provide additional context about the relationships between components in your pipeline, making the map more informative and easier to understand.
