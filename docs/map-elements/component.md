# Component

A **component** is any situation-relevant thing on a Wardley Map. Components can be activities (what you do), practices (how you do it), data, or knowledge. There is no single right level of granularityâ€”if something is important, it deserves a symbol on the map. Components can be broken down into smaller components as needed.

## Syntax

```text
component Name [Visibility, Maturity]
```

- **Name**: The label for the component.
- **Visibility (Y Axis)**: How visible the component is to the anchor/user.
- **Maturity (X Axis)**: The component's stage of evolution (see Evolution).

## Example

```text
component Cup of Tea [0.79, 0.61] label [-85.48, 3.78]
component Cup [0.73, 0.78]
component Tea [0.63, 0.81]
component Hot Water [0.52, 0.80]
component Water [0.38, 0.82]
component Kettle [0.43, 0.35] label [-57, 4]
```

The `label` attribute is optional and allows you to adjust the position of the component's label on the map.

If you get the granularity wrong, you will learn and adjust. Mapping is an iterative craft.

## Interactive Features

### Moving and Renaming Components

Components can be moved and renamed both through the text editor and directly on the map interface. For details about these interactive features, see [Component Drag and Drop](../map-features/drag-drop.md).
