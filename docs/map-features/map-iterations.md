- Visualize the expected evolution of components
- Map out strategic transformations
- Document planned changes and transitions

### Historical Insights
- Review historical development of your landscape
- Analyze trends and patterns
- Evaluate the effectiveness of past strategic decisions
- Learn from previous iterations

### Improved Collaboration
- Share specific iterations with team members
- Foster shared understanding of landscape changes
- Support strategic discussions with historical context
- Document and communicate strategic evolution

### Effortless Updates
- Easily modify maps in each iteration
- Track changes and adaptations
- Maintain a clear history of landscape evolution
- Document the rationale for changes

## Usage Tips

1. Create iterations at meaningful strategic intervals
2. Document significant changes between iterations
3. Use iterations to tell the story of your strategic journey
4. Reference specific iterations in strategic discussions

## Visual Example
