# Map Iterations

Map iterations allow you to capture the evolution of a Wardley Map over time, preserving each stage of your mapping journey.

## Overview

Iterations are a powerful feature of Online Wardley Maps that enable users to:

- Record different stages of map development
- Save multiple versions of the same map
- Easily switch between these versions
- Show the progression of a strategy or environment over time

## Using Iterations

The iterations controls appear at the bottom of the editor interface:

### Adding an Iteration

To create a new iteration of your map:

1. Click the **Add** button in the iterations toolbar
2. A new iteration will be created, based on your current map state
3. Make changes to this new iteration without affecting previous versions

:::tip
Use iterations to record different scenarios, hypothetical changes to your environment, or the planned evolution of your strategy over time.

### Navigating Between Iterations

- Use the **Next** and **Back** buttons to move between iterations
- Click directly on an iteration name in the stepper to jump to it

### Renaming Iterations

To give your iterations meaningful names:

1. Select the iteration you wish to rename
2. Click the **Rename** button
3. Enter a descriptive name in the dialog
4. Click **Update**

### Deleting Iterations

If you no longer need a particular iteration:

1. Select the iteration to delete
2. Click the **Delete** button
3. Confirm the deletion in the dialog

:::warning
Deleting an iteration cannot be undone. Make sure you want to permanently remove this version of your map.

## Iteration DSL

While iterations are primarily managed through the UI, they are stored in your map's data structure. When exporting your map or viewing its raw format, iterations will be preserved.

## Examples

Iterations are excellent for showing the progression of a strategy. For example:

1. **Current State** - Map the current environment
2. **6 Months** - Show planned changes in the near term
3. **1 Year** - Show the medium-term evolution
4. **3 Years** - Show the long-term strategic vision

By having all these states in a single map, you can tell a compelling story about your strategic direction.

## Best Practices

- **Name clearly** - Use consistent naming conventions for your iterations (e.g., dates, project phases)
- **Limit quantity** - Keep the number of iterations manageable (typically 3-7)
- **Use for storytelling** - Sequence iterations to build a narrative
- **Preserve key information** - Ensure important components and relationships persist between iterations
