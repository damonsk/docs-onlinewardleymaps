# Map Canvas Size

OnlineWardleyMaps allows you to override the default size of the map canvas using the DSL.

## Specifying Map Size

You can specify the size of the map canvas by adding a `size` directive in your map code with the desired width and height in pixels.

### Example

```plaintext
size [1024, 768]
```

This sets the map canvas width to 1024 pixels and height to 768 pixels.

## Behaviour

When you specify the map size, the map will render with the given dimensions, allowing you to control the layout and presentation of your map.
