# Drag and Drop

OnlineWardleyMaps supports interactive element manipulation directly on the map, making it easier to position and rename map elements without manually editing the map code.  Movable elements will have a blue glow when pressing either CMD or CTRL.

## Movement

You can move components on the map by using:
- CMD+Drag (macOS)
- CTRL+Drag (Windows/Linux)

This allows you to quickly reposition components by clicking and dragging them to their new location. The component's coordinates in the map code will automatically update to reflect the new position.

:::tip
If you accidentally move a component, you can press ESC to revert the last move operation.
