# Element Renaming

You can rename components in two ways:

1. Edit the component name in the text editor
2. Double-click the component label on the map to rename it directly
   - Press Enter to accept the new name
   - Press ESC to cancel the rename operation

:::tip
In the text editor, you can use the keyboard shortcut CMD+D (macOS) or Ctrl+D (Windows/Linux) to create multiple cursors and select instances of the component name for easy simultaneous editing.

This direct editing capability makes it easy to iterate on your map's structure and terminology without switching between the map view and code editor.
