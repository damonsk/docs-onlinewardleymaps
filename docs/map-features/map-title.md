# Map Title

You can set the title of your map using the DSL by specifying the `title` keyword followed by the desired title text.

## Example

```plaintext
title My Map Title Name
```

This sets the title of the map to "My Map Title Name".

## Behaviour

The title will be displayed prominently in the map presentation and can be used to identify the map.
