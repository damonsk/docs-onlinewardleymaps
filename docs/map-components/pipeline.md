# Pipeline

A **pipeline** represents a flow or process that connects components across stages of evolution. Pipelines are used to simplify the notation of complex requirement chains, making maps easier to read and understand.

> "Sometimes, there are many similar ways to accomplish the same thing... you might use a pipeline to simplify the notation." ([wardleymaps.com](https://www.wardleymaps.com/intro))

## Syntax

```text
pipeline Component Name [X Axis (start), X Axis (end)]
```

- **Component Name**: The element being pipelined.
- **X Axis (start)**: Where the pipeline begins on the evolution axis.
- **X Axis (end)**: Where the pipeline ends on the evolution axis.

## Example

```text
pipeline Customer [0.15, 0.9]
```

**Tip:** Use pipelines to clarify and condense complex flows in your map.
