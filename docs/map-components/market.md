# Market

A **market** is a special type of component that represents a market context or environment in your map. Markets help you visualize where competition, maturity, and commoditization are taking place.

## Syntax

```text
market Name [Visibility, Maturity]
```

- **Name**: The market or context being represented.
- **Visibility (Y Axis)**: How visible the market is to the anchor/user.
- **Maturity (X Axis)**: The market's stage of evolution.

## Example

```text
market Cup of Tea [0.9, 0.5]
```

**Tip:** Use markets to highlight where value chains interact with broader environments.
