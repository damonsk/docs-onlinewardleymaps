## Wardley Maps in Obsidian
I’m excited to announce a new project aimed at expanding access to Wardley mapping across even more tools, next up - [Obsidian.md](https://obsidian.md). For anyone who hasn't used it, Obsidian.md is a powerful, local-first note-taking tool loved by researchers, thinkers, and creators. Its flexibility and extendability make it a great home for Wardley maps—allowing you to visualise strategic landscapes directly within your notes.

As always, it's open-source by default. This new open-source plugin brings the popular, open format (OnlineWardleyMaps or OWM) for Wardley maps right into Obsidian. With it, you can create and interact with maps as part of your markdown files, offering a new way to keep maps tightly integrated with your workflows. While it’s still in early stages and requires a manual installation, the goal is to publish it soon for easy access.

Thanks for supporting this journey to make Wardley maps available in more tools. I hope this plugin inspires new ways of working with strategy and mapping in your daily notes!
