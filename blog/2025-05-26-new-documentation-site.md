# Welcome to the New Online Wardley Maps Documentation Site!

We are excited to announce the launch of our brand new documentation site for Online Wardley Maps (OWM). This site is designed to provide a comprehensive, easy-to-navigate resource for all things related to OWM, including our powerful DSL, plugins, and tools.

## What’s New?

- **Detailed Documentation:** Explore in-depth guides and references covering the Online Wardley Maps DSL, features, and usage.
- **Visual Examples:** See screenshots and GIFs demonstrating how to use the VSCode and Obsidian plugins, as well as the web editor.
- **Getting Started Guides:** Step-by-step instructions to help you quickly create and share your own Wardley Maps.
- **Open Source Focus:** Learn about our open source philosophy and how you can contribute to the project.
- **Cross-Platform Support:** Documentation for using OWM in your browser, VSCode, and Obsidian.

## Why This Matters

OnlineWardleyMaps is more than just a website — it is a comprehensive platform consisting of a powerful tool, its own language/DSL, a set of plugins, and the free (open source) OnlineWardleyMaps website. Together, these components empower strategic thinking through visual mapping. Our new documentation site reflects this by making it easier than ever to learn, use, and contribute.

## Get Involved

We encourage you to explore the documentation, try out the examples, and join the community. Your feedback and contributions help shape the future of Online Wardley Maps.

Thank you for being part of this journey!
