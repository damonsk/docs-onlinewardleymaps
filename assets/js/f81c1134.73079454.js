This is our most significant modernisation update to date, featuring a complete TypeScript migration, enhanced user interface, and streamlined DSL syntax.\\n\\n## \ud83c\udfaf Key Highlights\\n\\n### \u2728 Resizable Editor and Map Interface\\n\\nWe\'ve introduced a brand new **resizable split pane interface** that puts you in control of your workspace layout. Now you can dynamically adjust the space between the text editor and map canvas to suit your working style.\\n\\n![Editor Resize Feature](/img/divider.png)\\n\\n**How it works:**\\n- **Hover over the divider** between editor and map to see the resize cursor\\n- **Click and drag** left or right to adjust panel sizes\\n- **Automatic persistence** - your preferred layout is saved in your browser\\n- **Smart constraints** - 20% minimum to 60% maximum editor width to keep both panels functional\\n\\n**Perfect for different workflows:**\\n- **More editor space** (50-60%): Ideal for complex maps with detailed annotations\\n- **Balanced layout** (33% default): Great for most mapping tasks\\n- **More map space** (20-25%): Perfect when you primarily interact with the visual map\\n\\n:::tip\\nThe resize feature works seamlessly across light and dark themes, with the divider automatically adapting to your chosen interface style.\\n:::\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd27 DSL Syntax Modernisation\\n\\nWe\'ve simplified and modernised the Domain Specific Language (DSL) to make it more consistent and intuitive.\\n\\n### Market and Ecosystem Components\\n\\n**Legacy syntax (now removed):**\\n```text\\nmarket CustomerBase [0.9, 0.3]\\necosystem TechPlatform [0.4, 0.7]\\n```\\n\\n**New unified syntax:**\\n```text\\ncomponent CustomerBase [0.9, 0.3] (market)\\ncomponent TechPlatform [0.4, 0.7] (ecosystem)\\n```\\n\\n**Benefits of the new approach:**\\n- **Consistent syntax** across all component types\\n- **Decorator support** - combine market/ecosystem with build/buy/outsource\\n- **Better tooling** - improved syntax highlighting and auto-completion\\n- **Enhanced semantics** - markets and ecosystems are clearly specialised components\\n\\n### Enhanced Decorator Combinations\\n\\nThe new syntax enables powerful combinations:\\n\\n```text\\ncomponent SupplierMarket [0.8, 0.4] (market, outsource)\\ncomponent TechEcosystem [0.6, 0.2] (ecosystem, build)\\ncomponent Platform [0.5, 0.8] (market, buy)\\n```\\n\\n:::note\\n**Migration Guide:** Existing maps using the legacy `market` and `ecosystem` syntax will continue to work, but we recommend updating to the new decorator syntax for future compatibility and enhanced features.\\n:::\\n\\n## \ud83d\ude80 Complete TypeScript Migration\\n\\nOnlineWardleyMaps has undergone a **complete migration from JavaScript to TypeScript**, bringing significant improvements to code quality, developer experience, and application reliability.\\n\\n### What This Means for Users\\n\\n- **Enhanced Performance** - Better optimisation and faster rendering\\n- **Improved Reliability** - Stronger type checking prevents runtime errors\\n- **Better Error Messages** - More helpful feedback when something goes wrong\\n- **Future-Proof Architecture** - Foundation for upcoming features and improvements\\n\\n### Technical Improvements\\n\\n- **Unified Component Architecture** - Consistent interfaces across all map elements\\n- **Type-Safe Link Strategies** - Robust handling of component relationships\\n- **Modern React Patterns** - Improved state management and component lifecycle\\n- **Enhanced Symbol System** - Modular, performant SVG-based map elements\\n\\n## \ud83d\udee0\ufe0f Architecture Enhancements\\n\\n### Unified Map Elements\\n\\nThe new TypeScript architecture introduces a **unified component system** that treats all map elements consistently:\\n\\n```typescript\\ninterface UnifiedComponent {\\n  id: string;\\n  name: string;\\n  type: string; // \'component\' | \'anchor\' | \'market\' | \'ecosystem\'\\n  maturity: number;\\n  visibility: number;\\n  decorators?: ComponentDecorator;\\n  // ... additional properties\\n}\\n```\\n\\n### Improved Link Processing\\n\\nEnhanced link strategies provide more reliable component connections:\\n- **Strategy Pattern Implementation** - Clean separation of link determination logic\\n- **Evolution State Handling** - Elegant support for evolved and evolving components  \\n- **Performance Optimised** - Efficient filtering and processing of complex maps\\n\\n### Modern Symbol Components\\n\\nAll map symbols have been modernised with:\\n- **React.memo Optimisation** - Prevents unnecessary re-renders\\n- **Consistent Theming** - Better support for light/dark modes\\n- **Type Safety** - Full TypeScript coverage with proper interfaces\\n- **Modular Design** - Easy to extend and maintain\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcc8 Performance Improvements\\n\\nThe TypeScript migration brings noticeable performance improvements:\\n\\n- **Faster Map Rendering** - Optimised component lifecycle and memoisation\\n- **Reduced Memory Usage** - Better garbage collection and state management  \\n- **Improved Responsiveness** - Smoother interactions and transitions\\n- **Enhanced Scalability** - Better performance with large, complex maps\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd2e Looking Forward\\n\\nThis release establishes a solid foundation for future enhancements:\\n\\n- **Plugin Architecture** - Framework for community extensions\\n- **Advanced Analytics** - Enhanced map analysis and insights\\n- **Collaboration Features** - Real-time collaborative editing capabilities\\n- **Mobile Optimisation** - Improved experience on tablets and mobile devices\\n\\n## \ud83d\udcda Documentation Updates\\n\\nOur documentation has been updated to reflect all changes:\\n- [Editor and Map Resizing Guide](/docs/map-features/editor-map-resize)\\n- [Updated DSL Reference](/docs/dsl-reference)  \\n- [Component Syntax Guide](/docs/map-elements/component)\\n- [Market & Ecosystem Elements](/docs/map-elements/market)\\n\\n## \ud83d\udd17 Supporting the Project\\n\\nOnlineWardleyMaps remains free and open-source.

Major release to bring Quality of Life improvements and new features.\\n\\n## New Features\\n\\n### Pipelines V2\\n\\nWe\'ve revamped the pipeline components to enhance the positioning of choice components. This improvement introduces a new syntax, detailed below.\\n\\n#### Key Highlights:\\n\\n##### Improved Positioning:\\nExperience enhanced placement of choice components within your pipelines for a more streamlined and intuitive workflow.\\n\\n##### New Syntax:\\nExplore the updated syntax that accompanies this change, providing you with a more expressive and efficient way to define your pipeline components.\\n\\n##### Backward Compatibility:\\nFear not! Both the new and old syntax will be supported, ensuring a smooth transition for all users.\\n\\n\\n#### Legacy syntax & view\\n\\nThe old syntax created a view which positioned two components at the given maturity.\\n\\n\\n```\\npipeline Kettle [0.1, 0.9]\\n```\\n\\n![Legacy Pipeline View](./rn-12-23-01.png)\\n\\n#### Version 2 syntax & view\\n\\nNew version allows nested components which only require their maturity to be specified as they will inherit visibility position from the parent pipeline.\\n\\n```\\ncomponent Kettle [0.45, 0.57]\\npipeline Kettle\\n{\\n  component Campfire Kettle [0.50]\\n  component Electric Kettle [0.63]\\n}\\n\\n```\\n\\n![Version 2 Pipeline View](./rn-12-23-02.png)\\n\\n[View an example map which highlights the changes](https://beta.onlinewardleymaps.com/#clone:703Ni4Dth65U1mJBCf)\\n\\n### Annotate value chain links\\n\\nYou can now specify additional context to links by using the optional operator.  This will allow you to highlight which links are \\"limited by\\", \\"constraint\\" or \\"feedback loop\\" without using notes.  Example below.\\n\\n```\\nHot Water->Kettle; limited by \\n```\\n\\n![Optional text](./rn-12-23-06.png)\\n\\n### Evolve name changes\\n\\nIt may be the case that the evolved component will need to represent something new. \\n\\nLike Physical Space to Virtual Space. \\n\\nYou can now specify the new name of the evolved component using the syntax below.  Virtual Space will be the new component name.\\n\\n```\\ncomponent Physical Space [0.91, 0.46]\\nevolve Physical Space->Virtual Space 0.8\\n```\\n\\n![Evolve name changes](./rn-12-23-05.png)\\n\\n\\n[View an example map which highlights the changes](https://onlinewardleymaps.com/#clone:evolve-name-change)\\n\\n### Map Iterations\\n\\nIterations represent a significant evolution in the way you interact with your Wardley Maps. They allow you to capture the dynamic nature of your landscape over time, enabling a richer and more detailed representation of the evolution of your strategic elements.\\n\\n#### Possible uses:\\n\\n##### Time-Phased Evolution:\\nWith Iterations, you can now create snapshots of your Wardley Map at different points in time, capturing the evolution of components, relationships, and strategies.\\n\\n\\n##### Enhanced Strategic Planning:\\nPlan and visualize the future states of your landscape by creating iterations that depict the expected evolution of your components and their interdependencies.\\n\\n\\n##### Historical Insights:\\nGain valuable insights into the historical development of your landscape by navigating through different iterations, allowing you to analyze trends, patterns, and the effectiveness of strategic decisions over time.\\n\\n##### Improved Collaboration:\\nCollaborate seamlessly with your team by sharing and discussing specific iterations, fostering a shared understanding of the evolving landscape and supporting strategic decision-making.\\n\\n##### Effortless Mapping Updates:\\nEasily update and modify your Wardley Map in each iteration, reflecting changes and adaptations as your landscape evolves.\\n\\nIterations empower you to move beyond static representations, allowing you to embrace the dynamic nature of strategic planning. By incorporating time-phased evolution into your Wardley Maps, you can make informed decisions, adapt to change, and drive success in an ever-evolving landscape.\\n\\n![Wardley Map Iterations](./rn-12-23-09.jpeg)\\n\\n## Quality of Life Improvements\\n\\n### Facelift & Light/Dark Themes\\n\\nOWM has moved away from Bootstrap and now using MaterialUI.  With this change comes a more modern look and feel. \\n\\n#### Dark / Light modes.\\n\\nBy default, OWM will load using a dark theme, including the editor.  You can also take advantage of dark maps by using the ``style dark``.\\n\\nYou can toggle light/dark theme from the left hand menu. \\n\\n![Dark Theme](./rn-12-23-08.jpeg)\\n\\n![Alt text](./rn-12-23-11.jpeg)\\n\\n### Classic Online Wardley Maps\\n\\nNot ready to move across?  You can still access the old website - [https://classic.onlinewardleymaps.com](https://classic.onlinewardleymaps.com)\\n\\n\\n### Unsaved Changes \\n\\nUsing the browser, the user will be prompted if they navigate away when there are outstanding map changes.  This one gets me all the time.\\n\\n### Presentation / Editor Mode \\n\\nThis will allow you to hide the map text / editor to give a fullscreen view of the map.  This will also allow maps to be viewed from a mobile device in portrait mode.\\n\\n![Presentation View](./rn-12-23-03.png)\\n\\n\\n### Fullscreen mode.\\n\\nRemove the header and iterations and go fullscreen with your map and editor.  You can also use this with Presentation mode leaving you with just your map.\\n\\n![Toggle Fullscreen](./rn-12-23-10.png)\\n\\n### Export as SVG\\n\\nNow you can take your maps and load them directly into your favorite SVG editor. This feature empowers you to further customise and refine your maps using the tools you love.\\n\\n![Export as SVG](./image.png)\\n\\n## Bugfixes \\n\\n### Changes to drag/drop\\n\\nA bug manifested after elements on the map are moved followed by a ESC key press later on.  The keypress would incorrectly revert the moved element often making the map appear broken.\\n \\n### Usage Guide\\n\\nUntil today, the documentation website (this website) was not accessible via the onlinewardleymaps.com website.

[Skip ahead](#get-the-extension) if you\'re already setup.  \\n\\nHead over to [https://code.visualstudio.com/download](https://code.visualstudio.com/download) and download and install the version for your operating system.\\n\\n## Get the extension\\n\\nOnce Visual Studio Code is installed and running, search and install Wardley Maps extension from the Extensions panel. To get to the Extensions panel, from the file menu, select `View` -> `Extensions`.  You can also use the keyboard shortcut (Windows) `Ctrl+Shift+X` (macOS) `Cmd+Shift+X`.\\n\\nSimply search for and install the extension `Wardley Maps` shown below.\\n\\n**Alternatively**, if you are familiar with VSCode, you can shortcut this process by entering the following command into the Command Palette ((Windows) `Ctrl+Shift+P` / (macOS) `Cmd+Shift+P`).  `ext install damonsk.vscode-wardley-maps`\\n\\n![Searching for VS Code Extension](./vscode-extensions-search.png)\\n\\n## Using the extension\\n\\n- [Syntax Highlighting](#syntax-highlighting)\\n- [Displaying Maps](#displaying-maps)\\n- [Auto Completions](#auto-completions)\\n- [Snippets](#snippets)\\n\\n### Syntax Highlighting\\n\\nTo reduce the cognitive load when reading maps as code, this extension brings with it syntax highlighting.  \\n\\nTo enable syntax highlighting, you have two options.  By default, any file with an extenion of `.wm` or `.owm` will auto enable the syntax highlighting.\\n\\nFor existing files, or new unsaved files, you can set the Language Mode.\\n\\nUsing the Command Palette (keyboard shortcut: (Windows) `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS) `Cmd+Shift+P`) enter `Change Language Mode`, press enter and then select `Wardley Map`\\n\\n![Setting Language Mode](./vscode-set-language.gif)\\n\\n### Displaying Maps\\n\\nUsing the Command Palette (keyboard shortcut: (Windows) `Ctrl+Shift+P` (macOS) `Cmd+Shift+P`) enter `Wardley Maps: Display Map` and then press enter.\\n\\n![Display Wardley Map](./vscode-display-map.gif)\\n\\n### Auto Completions\\n\\nTo access the code completions (or intellisense) within the text editor, press `Ctrl+Space`.  Code completions (shown in red below) will contain both the keywords (such as `component` `anchor` `ecosystem`) as well as any variables specific to your map.  For example, `component Hot Water [...]` will result in a variable `Hot Water`.  Variables can be used to link components in a value chain.  `Hot Water->Water`\\n\\n![Display Code Completions](./vscode-completions.png)\\n\\n### Snippets\\n\\nSimilar to code completions, to access snippets within the text editor, press `Ctrl+Space`.  Snippets (shown in yellow below) are complete examples which you can modify, you may `tab` between placeholders for quick editing.  \\n\\nThe following snippet `anchor name [0.9, 0.1]` has three placeholders.\\n\\n`anchor <initial text cursor> [<tab to edit>, <tab again to edit>]`\\n\\n![Display Code Snippets](./vscode-completions.png)\\n\\n\\n## License & Source\\n\\nThis project is licensed under the [MIT license](https://github.com/damonsk/vscode-wardley-maps/blob/master/LICENSE) and the source code can be found at [github.com/damonsk/vscode-wardley-maps](https://github.com/damonsk/vscode-wardley-maps).\\n\\n## Support the Project\\n\\nIf you find [obsidian-wardley-maps](https://github.com/damonsk/obsidian-wardley-maps), [OnlineWardleyMaps](https://github.com/damonsk/onlinewardleymaps) or [vscode-wardley-maps](https://github.com/damonsk/vscode-wardley-maps) valuable, consider supporting its development:\\n\\n[![Patreon](https://c5.patreon.com/external/logo/become_a_patron_button.png)](https://www.patreon.com/mapsascode/overview)\\n\\nFollow on X (Twitter) [@MapsAsCode](https://x.com/mapsascode) for updates and announcements!\\n\\nYour support helps maintain and improve this plugin as well as OnlineWardleyMaps and vscode-wardley-maps.
